in StoreReloc:

[code];added>>
L0:
...
If D$RelocSectionSize = 8 ; if unused RelocSection, reuse it for Next
 add D$RelocPage PageSize | mov eax D$RelocPage |
 mov ecx D$RelocationPtr | mov D$ecx-8 eax | jmp L0<

;jE! added>>
        If D$RelocSectionSize = 8                   ; Case of no relocation
            sub D$RelocationPtr 8                   ; wanted in CODE

           mov eax D$Relocation | mov D$eax 0 | mov D$eax+4 08
           add D$RelocationPtr 8
        End_If

20.
incorrect conversion happens for NEGATIVE numbers in QWORD definition;
[TESTQ: Q$ 0-1] will stored in DATA as 00000000_FFFFFFFF;
must be FFFFFFFF_FFFFFFFF;

Bugs i found here in StoreOneData:
after
[code]L4: call TranslateDecimal ; EDX:EAX return
for QWORD we jump to Q7>
...
Q7:     If B$DataSign = &TRUE
            neg eax | neg ebx;
;ERROR n1. why EBX?? must EDX!
;ERROR n2. NEG 0 = 0, so we lost HIGH_dword in EDX as -1
        End_If
[/code]

doing NEG on high-dword will not give correct QWORD..
correct is only full SUB/SBB operation:

[code]Q7:     If B$DataSign = &TRUE
            push 0 | push 0 | sub D$esp eax | sbb D$esp+4 edx ;jE!
            pop eax | pop edx
        End_If
[/code]

21.
incorrect loop can happen in CheckExtendedVirtual, bcoz not checked NumberOfSections;
4 lines added marked with: ;jE!



22. in "WritePeHeaders" fixed for drivers:
[code]
  mov W$edi-2 1 ; SubSystem NATIVE jE! - corrected.
  mov ax 0; &IMAGE_DLLCHARACTERISTICS_WDM_DRIVER. removed WDM, bcoz WDM is not unloadable
[/code]


ADDed missed mnemonics RETF, CALLF, JMPF in assembler
23.
RETF assembles with same rule as RET;

24-25.
CALLF & JMPF have two variants
1st- memory-ptr CALLF & JMPF assembles with same rule as same_segment far CALL & JMP
just BIT changed in Opcode2; in memory should be EIP:CS / 6byte long struct
[code]
    CALLF D$MEM32_DataLabel
    CALLF D$eax
    JMPF  D$eax+imm
    CALLF D$eax+edx+imm
    JMPF  D$esp+ebp*4+imm

    CALLF W$eax; <  here in MEM32 should be IP:CS for 16bit code call/jump
                    4byte long struct
[/code]
direct address CALLF-JMPF:
first Word is Segment, second Dword EIP (write without ':')
[code]
    CALLF D$03333 077778888
    JMPF D$03333 Label (not Local)
[/code]
or first Word is Segment, second Word IP for 16bit code call
    CALLF W$03333 07788
    JMPF  W$03333 07788

26. fixed Disassembler for compatible output (was 'CALLF32/16' 'JMP32/16' strings)

27. fixed PE-header values for drivers in "WritePeHeaders":
[code]
  Else_If D$SavingExtension = '.SYS'
    mov W$edi-2 1 ; SubSystem NATIVE jE! - corrected.
    mov ax 0; &IMAGE_DLLCHARACTERISTICS_WDM_DRIVER. removed WDM, bcoz WDM is not unloadable
[/code]

28. fixed miss-tape
[code]
im16Size:
    On D$imm32 >= 010000,  error D$OverWordPtr; << was OverBytePtr
    mov B$TrueSize WordSize
  ret
[/code]

29. allowed missed down-direction LOOP assembly & disassembly

30. added variable "RelocsWanted" & RELOC-checkbox in "Output" options. (DLG_res changed)
now you can force RELOCations in EXEcutable or force NO-RELOCations in DLL.
On New_File case, flag will be reset for EXE & set for DLL;
On Existing_file case (or on Disassembly) flag will be set as in Source_file.
SYS-files always will be with RELOCs.

31. fixed rare-case crash on RightClick in Title "Click",
caused by "D$MacroNamePointer" variable

32. allowed all SREG R/M/32bit MOVes assembly & disassembly
(was allowed only SREG REG32)
easy done by: "mov B$wBitDisagree &FALSE"

33. added DialogEX structure "light" support.
Rosasm's DialogEditor did crash on DialogEx structure in RSRC, came from Disasmed files.
.I changed "FromBinToTextTemplate" code, so it will convert DislogEX to Dialog struct.
HELPID member will only lost in conversion.
.EXSTYLE member will preserved in structure, becouse XP cares about it!
for this, also updated "FromTextToBinTemplate" & Dlg to file saver.
."NextTemplateLine" macro simplfied.
.Font-member will injected, if not exists.
."ControlIndex" values was defined as numbers, so code was very non-informative.
I defined equates: [Line_Style 0 | Line_exStyle 1 .... Line_empty 7]
& then found&replaced all need numbers in "TITLE Dialog". (crasy work, ~40places)
.Removed WS_THICKFRAME style from ListControl, becouse can overlap below controls

34. fixed crashES in StringsEditor!
i corrected "Group16Strings" logic, so it will no more crash on any kind deletion.
+optimiZjEd (Store one String to "OneStringBuffer") code > copyU_with_count

35. fixed "LOCK OR" assembly error.
SPACE check was at B$esi+3, should B$esi+2. (probably copy-pasted)
+simplified LOCK BTx IF-logic.

36. fixed crash in "NewHowManyExport".
>> reinvented in 38 fix >>

37.
.Export-ModuleName unusual placement moved to end of Export names array without upcase_r.
.for ExportNames full sorting added new-proc DualBubbleSortExportListPointers and variable: ExportListPointers
.ColonSign replaces ':' as DataExport marker.
.for debug added variable "ExportALL" and upgraded procs: NewPrepareExport, NewHowManyExport, NewStoreToExportListA
.also in NewStoreToExportListA added final precise calculation of Export section size (added variable: NumberOfDataExports)
.added "TooManyExports" error string (<010000);
.in "Output tab" will add check-box for choosing ExportALL (DLG_res changed)
for check-box managing added few lines of code in "Format" title.
.fixed CRLF_adding at end of source in proc KillTrailingSpaces
.fixed any found CMP W$x 'PE' to D$x 'PE'

38.
.introdused rule using Colon with Spaces for Labels:
NoSpaceBeforeColon & MustSpaceAfterColon, added Error strings for this.
according of this, fixed any appropriate places in source like:
P9:]
to
P9: ]
also for this upgraded NewStoreToExportListA & NewHowManyExport;
+ upgraded Error reporting for show error place in Source
.macros Local & Arguments changed to simple ones

//////////////
Now letZZ change RosAsm version for huge update:
New Full Name EXPORT managing!!!

RosAsm2052f      (c,d,e used Guga)

Full EXPORTs has following format:
1. with not defined ordinals - to Exported LABEL immediate(no-space)
append full-name-ANSI-string in Quotes:

MyExpLabel::'@this%is$full#name!'

2. If also Ordinal required - name Exported LABEL as 'ORD' + hex-number:

ORD01::'@this%is$full#Name_with_ordinal #1 !'
..
ORD0FFFF::'@this%is$full#Name_with_ordinal #65535 !'

3. If only Ordinal need without name:
ORD01::
..
ORD0FFFF::

Updated Procs:
.(in DIS, for same full output!)
WriteExportedFunctionLabel
CheckExport
.(in Tools_exec) fixed Export-reading for best :) (only-Ordinal cases)
ViewExport
GetExportScannerFile
GetExportDirPointer
InitExportsProcList
ExportFunctionFindFirst
.(in EXPORT-builder procs)
NewHowManyExport
NewStoreToExportListA
FillExportSection
StoreExportAdresse
StoreExportNamePtr
StoreExportOrdinal
StoreFunctionName
DualBubbleSortExportListPointers_AndOrdinals
.added Procs:
CheckExportOrdinal
FindExportFullNameString (Error-report)
FindLostExportString (Error-report)
ErrorStrings: BadExportOrdinal SameExportOrdinal
.added Variables:
NumberOfDisExportNames DisExportOrdBase NumberOfJunkBytes ExpOrdArray
OnlyOrdinalExport OrdinalExport ExpOrdBase

>>>now RosAsm can DIS & reAssemble MSVCP50.dll with it's huge ExpNames<<<

.removed many unwanted &FILE_SHARE_WRITE from any Call CreateFileA..
.in StoreAllMacros fixed '<' char case, it was above xored by 080..

; this bad taped> [ B|uildCommentedCodeReference:: 32 ] infinite_loop in macros-jobs!!!
