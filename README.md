This is my continued work on upgrade & enhancement of RosAsm starting from version 2052f

ABOUT RosAsm: see file "B_U_Asm.EXE" in "RosAsmFiles.7z"

Create directory "RosAsm", unpack files from "RosAsmFiles.7z" here.
Then download latest released executable and also unpack and put here.
On first run, configure RosAsm. Menu>Tools>Configuration. Also "Create Config.bin"
